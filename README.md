# WeatherSync

## üå¶Ô∏è Real-time Weather Fetching Application with Spring Boot

WeatherSync is a RESTful Spring Boot application designed to fetch and display real-time weather information based on city input. This project seamlessly integrates external APIs to retrieve accurate weather data from OpenWeatherMap, providing users with essential details like temperature, pressure, humidity, and weather conditions.

The project is developed to demonstrate backend API integration, clean code principles, and a robust error-handling mechanism, making it a perfect fit for learning, development, and enhancement.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Fetch Real-time Weather**: Input any city name and get real-time weather details, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Spring Boot REST API**: Developed with Spring Boot to create lightweight and robust RESTful APIs.
